# Table Component Overview

This is a React project that utilizes the **PrimeReact** library to display a paginated table with selectable rows. It fetches data from an API (in this case, an API for artwork details), displays it in a table, and allows for pagination and row selection. The project also includes dynamic error handling and loading indicators.
